This repository contains the source code for the [Kamarikuoro Kaamos website][kaamos-website], hosted on Netlify.

## Editing Content

All **dynamic content**, such as news or concerts, lives in various files inside this repo's `content` directory. The easiest and safest way to edit this content is via the [Kaamos CMS panel][kaamos-cms], which is powered by Netlify CMS. Once saved, a new build is kicked off and the changes are live within a couple of minutes.

**Static content**, which is typically longer-lived and contains multiple paragraphs or styling, can be found in the [source files][pages-source]. To update such content, edit its file either directly on GitHub, or clone this repo and commit your changes. Be sure not to break any markup ðŸ™‚

## Deployment

Committing to the `main` branch of this repo will auto-deploy the site to Netlify. Deploys can be monitored and manually triggered via the [Netlify dashboard][netlify-deploys].
